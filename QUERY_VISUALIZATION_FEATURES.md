- **Better Context Integration**: Synthesizes information from multiple sources
- **Comprehensive Explanations**: Provides detailed answers with examples when available

### 2. Query-Specific Vector Visualization
- **Retrieved Chunks Highlighting**: Shows exactly which document chunks were used to answer each query
- **Interactive 2D Plots**: UMAP, t-SNE, and PCA visualizations of the entire document space
- **Visual Query Analysis**: Red star markers highlight retrieved chunks against gray background of all documents
- **Hover Information**: Detailed tooltips showing chunk content, source, and similarity scores

### 3. Enhanced Analytics Dashboard
- **Three-Tab Layout**: 
  - Query Performance: Response times, confidence scores, trends
  - Document Overview: Database statistics, document distribution
  - Vector Space: Interactive visualization of all documents

### 4. Improved Chat Interface
- **Expandable Query Analysis**: Each query now has detailed analysis section
- **Retrieved Chunks Details**: Shows similarity scores and content for each retrieved chunk
- **Performance Metrics**: Enhanced metrics including similarity scores and chunk information
- **Backward Compatibility**: Handles both old and new chat history formats

### 5. Better Database Management
- **Windows-Friendly Reset**: Handles file locking issues on Windows
- **Collection Clearing**: Safer method to clear documents without file system issues
- **Append Mode**: Option to add documents without clearing existing ones
- **Proper Embeddings Retrieval**: Fixed ChromaDB embeddings access

## ðŸŽ¨ Visual Features

### Query Visualization
```
ðŸŽ¯ Retrieved Chunks Visualization
- Gray dots: All document chunks in vector space
- Red stars: Chunks retrieved for the specific query
- Interactive hover: Shows chunk content and metadata
- Multiple dimensionality reduction methods (UMAP, t-SNE, PCA)
```

### Performance Metrics
```
ðŸ“Š Enhanced Metrics Display
- Response Time: How fast the system responds
- Confidence Score: Estimated reliability (improved algorithm)
- Max Similarity: Highest similarity score among retrieved chunks
- Retrieved Chunks: Number of chunks used for the answer
- Source Diversity: Variety of sources used
```

### Document Overview
```
ðŸ“š Database Statistics
- Total chunks in database
- Number of unique documents
- Character count and average chunk size
- Document distribution pie chart
- Per-document chunk breakdown
```

## ðŸ”§ Technical Improvements

### Database Operations
- **Safe Collection Clearing**: Uses ChromaDB's delete method instead of file system operations
- **Proper Embeddings Access**: Explicitly requests embeddings with `include` parameter
- **Error Handling**: Better error messages and fallback strategies
- **Memory Management**: Garbage collection to help with file handle release

### Query Engine Enhancements
- **Retrieved Document Info**: Returns detailed information about retrieved chunks
- **Similarity Scores**: Provides min, max, and average similarity scores
- **Content Matching**: Enables finding retrieved chunks in the full document space

### Streamlit App Architecture
- **Modular Visualization**: Separate methods for different visualization types
- **State Management**: Proper handling of session state and chat history
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient embedding retrieval and processing

## ðŸš€ Usage Examples

### 1. Upload Documents
```
1. Upload PDF files using the sidebar
2. Choose whether to clear existing documents or append
3. Process files to add to vector database
```

### 2. Chat with Documents
```
1. Ask questions in the chat interface
2. Get comprehensive answers with source citations

3. View detailed chunk content and similarity scores
4. Compare different dimensionality reduction methods
```

### 4. Explore Document Space
```
1. Go to Analytics â†’ Vector Space tab
2. See all documents plotted in 2D space
3. Hover over points to see content
4. Understand document clustering and relationships
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Benefits for Users
