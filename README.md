# RAG Explorations

This repository contains experiments and implementations exploring Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques. RAG is a powerful approach that combines the benefits of retrieval-based and generative AI methods to create more accurate and contextually relevant responses.

## Overview

RAG works by:
1. Retrieving relevant documents/passages from a knowledge base
2. Augmenting the input prompt with this retrieved context
3. Generating responses using the combined context

## Project Structure

The repository will contain:
- Implementation examples of RAG systems
- Experiments with different retrieval methods
- Comparisons of various embedding techniques
- Performance evaluations and benchmarks

## Getting Started

Instructions for setting up and running the examples will be added as they are developed.
